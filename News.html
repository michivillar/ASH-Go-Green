            <body>All Saints Legacy Teaching Garden</body>
            <body>by : OCSB Staff | Published: Novemeber 9, 2023</body>

            <center><body>The fall of 2020 brought with it a new challenge: the need for a safe and welcoming outdoor learning space. Vanessa Kirtz, Head of the Contemporary Studies Department, and Penny Lessard, Resource and Geography Teacher, recognized the importance of providing a space where students could gather without masks and reconnect with nature.</body></center>
            <hr>
            <center><body>Given the toll the pandemic had. it already had some existing features, such as a 2008 graduation legacy lilac bush, a tulip bed with 75 tulips donated by the Embassy of the Netherlands to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands, an overgrown Medicine Wheel garden, and a cairn that contained a time capsule created by the first All Saints High School graduates. The main challenge was to develop an expanded and functional space that would incorporate and preserve all of these existing features.</body></center>
            <hr>
            <center><body>The project started with the teachers seeking funding. They approached several sources, including the OCSB Experiential Learning Fund, Veterans Affairs, other OCSB funding options, and the school’s parent council. Additionally, they participated in a radio contest and won. The funding acquired through these sources was used, in part, to donate to the Vimy Foundation. The school received one of the last Vimy Ridge oak trees, which was grown from an acorn a Canadian World War I soldier sent back and planted.</body></center>
            <hr>
            <center><body>With some base funding in place, they hired a landscape designer to pull all their ideas together into a workable plan. Then, it was time for the students, staff, and local community to unite and make the plan a reality. Staff and community volunteers helped move the lilac and cairn, expand the flour beds and medicine wheel, and install rock benches. Four local landscaping companies helped by donating supplies such as the pavers and polymeric sand that the staff installed.</body></center>
            <hr>
            <center><body>With the physical space laid out, the students from various classes joined in to bring the garden to life. The plants for the garden were cultivated in the school greenhouse and then transplanted by the students. Classes researched the plants in the medicine wheel and created Métis dot art depicting the plants. </body></center>
            <hr>
            <center><body>Other students created a website showcasing the garden and the art and containing all the information about the plants. The tulips from the Netherlands were planted by history class students who had contributed to the organization Face to Graves by researching and writing the life stories of Canadian soldiers who are buried at Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery in the Netherlands. These students planted the bulbs in the name of the soldier they researched, The school’s Go Green team looks after gardens during the school year, and students needing volunteer hours help out during summer.</body></center>
            <hr>
            <center><body>The entire project, from concept to completion, took three years and is a testament to the care and dedication of the entire school community. The school held a dedication ceremony in May 2023, where they thanked students, staff, community supporters, parents, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and Veterans Affairs for making their legacy teaching garden come to fruition.</body></center>

            <body>E-Waste Initiative Targets Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling</body>
              <body>by : Samira Tasneem | Published: October 19, 2023</body>
              <hr>
              <body>In a concerted effort to tackle the burgeoning issue of electronic waste (e-waste), Pyxera Global and Terra have launched the “Done with It” pilot program, with the American Battery Technology Company (ABTC) at the helm of recycling operations. This initiative, buoyed by the backing of FedEx, is set to recycle lithium-ion batteries from discarded electronics, a significant step towards a more sustainable logistics sector.</body>
              <hr>
             <body>The program invites U.S. residents to donate their outdated laptops and tablets, which will undergo a process to erase their internal memory before being assessed for repair or recycling. The batteries from these devices are earmarked for ABTC's facility in Nevada, where they will be stripped of metal materials for reuse, especially in electric vehicle batteries.
              The pilot program, which runs from August 23 to December 15, 2023, is orchestrated to test the waters on the feasibility of recovering used electronics at a commercial scale. The primary focus is on salvaging critical components and materials from consumer laptops and tablets before they are relegated to the waste pile.</body> 
              <hr>
              <body>Once collected, the electronic devices are directed to a secure FedEx facility located in middle Tennessee, before their batteries are transported to ABTC's recycling center in Nevada.</body>
              <hr>
              <body>ABTC, a Nevada-based company, recently commenced operations at its commercial-scale lithium-ion battery recycling facility. This enterprise underscores a paradigm shift in viewing end-of-life batteries as valuable resources rather than waste. With a hydrometallurgical process, ABTC extracts essential battery materials, championing a sustainable and ethical sourcing of these critical materials. The process not only curtails the environmental footprint but also reduces the reliance on conventional mining methods, heralding a new era of resource recovery and recycling.</body>
              <hr>
              <body>As the tide of e-waste continues to swell, initiatives like the “Done with It” pilot program are imperative in steering the logistics and technology sectors towards a circular economy. By harnessing the untapped potential of e-waste, especially lithium-ion batteries, stakeholders can significantly cut down the environmental cost of electronic gadgets and propel the industry towards a sustainable future.</body>
